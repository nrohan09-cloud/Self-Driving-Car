# Self-Driving-Car
The code and model used by my team for autonomous control in the self-driving-car simulator. This was for the second problem statement of the competition Mosaic, Udyam 2020 organised by the Electronics Engineering Society, IIT(BHU), Varanasi. Our team placed third.

# Files

`model.py` is the script used for training the model,
`drive.py` is the script which connects with the simulator and uses the trained model to drive the car.
You can use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the dependencies.

# Credits 
The [simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim) used was developed by udacity. The model was taken from [this NVIDIA paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.07316).
